# PaladinsRandomLoadout
Are you Insane enough to take the Random Loadout Generator Challenge?


What is this?

  An application that randomly picks champion(optional) and creates random loadouts of 15 points to try with!
  Just a fun app I designed to play with friends, feel free to try yourself too!
  
How to use?
  Just run the "Generate Random Loadout.exe" and create random loadouts with random champions!(optional)


While I don't mind if the source code is modified/reused for personal use, I expect it won't be used piublically without my attention :D
